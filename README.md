Notebooks that we've made to practice new concepts and experiment with APIs

## Supplying credentials
Of course, I'm not adding my client secrets to this repository. However, I do want to standardize reading secrets to make the repository more accessible.

[keys_example.json](keys_example.json) contains the structure of the keys.json file that many of the notebooks reference. To use it, simply insert your credentials into the fields then change the name of the file to `keys.json`
